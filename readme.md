# Simon Says

## Introduction
Simon Says is a classic memory skill game that challenges players to keep up with an increasing sequence of lights. This project is a webbased version that allows you to play the game just using your web browser.

## Gameplay
The game starts at level one with a single light sequence. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, they move up a level, and an additional light is added to the sequence. The game continues until the player misses a sequence, at which point the game is over.

## How to Start the Game
 Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the game.
 Press any key on your keyboard to initiate the first sequence and begin playing.

## How to Play
 Watch the sequence of button flashes carefully.
 Click on the buttons in the order that they flashed.
 After each successful round, the sequence will increase by one.
 If you press the wrong button, the game will end, and your score will be displayed.

## Features
 Multiple levels of difficulty as you progress.
 Score tracking to see how well you're doing.
 Responsive design for various display sizes.
